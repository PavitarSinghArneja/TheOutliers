## 🚀 What is this madness?

Welcome to **The Outliers** – a community platform that's absolutely *unhinged* in the best possible way. We're talking about a place where biology nerds transform into innovation legends, where crazy ideas become world-changing realities, and where "impossible" is just another word for "challenge accepted."

### 💥 The Vibe Check
- **🔴 Code Red**: Hack biology like a rebel. Build apps that break boundaries.
- **🔵 Catalyst**: Be the spark that ignites global change.
- **🟡 UNwell**: Heal the world your way (MUN-style chaos included).
- **🟢 Grey Matter**: Think beyond limits. Your brain = ultimate frontier.
